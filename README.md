# Enabling a quick check on gene expression in eukaryotes
In this section of the course, we approach a quick analysis of gene expression. The type of data to be used include Illumina reads from NextSeq 500, as well as the genome assembly and annotation previously developed.
This section of the course includes:
* Indexing
* Alignment
* Differential expression analysis

The data to be analyzed in this section comes from the paper: [A chromosome-scale assembly of the smallest Dothideomycete genome reveals a unique genome compaction mechanism in filamentous fungi](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6732-8 "Wang et al. BMC Genomics 21:321 (2020)").

The approach for this section will be modular. Thus, a long script is not going to be provided, but you can make your own.
